## Patents
This repository contains some codes implementing the contents of AXELL CORPORATION's patents.

Below is the README for TFHEpp.

# TFHEpp
TFHEpp is full Scracthed pure C++ Ver. of TFHE. TFHEpp is slightly(about 10%) faster than original [TFHE implementation](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe). In addition to that, THFEpp supports [Circuit Bootstrapping](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/421), [Programable Boootstrapping many LUT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/729), [Partial Key](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/979) (Named as subset key in the code),and [Modifed Chen's Packing](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1318) (We call it as annihilate key switching in our code). 
We also includes partial support for B/FV, written in include/bfv++.hpp.
TFHEpp depends on AVX2 because we use SPQLIOS FMA. If you want run TFHEpp without AVX2, see spqlios++ branch. It include pure C++ implementation of SPQLIOS as header only library, but slow.

# Supported Compiler

This code includes utf-8 identifiers like Î±, using `extern template`, and std::make_unique_for_overwrite. Therefore, GCC11 or later and Clang16 or later are primarily supported compilers. 

# Parameter
The default parameter (128bit.hpp) is 128-bit security. Please add -DUSE_80BIT_SECURITY=ON to use a faster but less secure parameter.
The fastest parameter with 128-bit security is concrete.hpp. Please add -DUSE_CONCRETE=ON to use a faster parameter. 
If you need your own parameter, please modify the files under include/params/ or add your own hpp and add change the macro definition in include/param.hpp. 

## Ternary Key
As you will see in the files under include/params, we use ternary key for lvl1 or higher levels parameters. 

# FFTW3 Support
Some environments which do not support AVX2 cannot use spqlios. Instead of spqlios, TFHEpp can use fftw3.
To use fftw3,  install `libfftw3-dev` and add `-DUSE_FFTW3=ON` to the compile option.

# Third party libraries
Codes under thirdparties directory contain third-party libraries, Randen, BLAKE3, Cereal, and SPQLIOS. See the corresponding directory to check the licenses.

## Randen
Previous (till Version 9 in release tags) TFHEpp uses this as a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). Original repository is [here](https://github.com/google/randen).
I just removed some unnecessary codes, with no modification. 
This is now deprecated. To use this, set `-DUSE_BLAKE3=OFF -DUSE_RANDEN=ON` explicitly. 

## BLAKE3
This is used as another CSPRNG implementation using its eXtended Output Function (XOF) mode. Because Randen is not peer-reviewed algorithm and BLAKE3 is now bit faster than RANDEN, we are now using this as a default CSPRNG. 
FYI, CRYSTAL-Kyber is using SHA-3's XOF as a CSPRNG generator. We are currently not implemening this because it is slow. 
Micorosft SEAL implements BLAKE2 as one of the supported CSPRNGs. 

## Cereal
cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. TFHEpp uses this to export ciphertexts and keys. Cereal is treated by the git submodule.

## SPQLIOS
SPQLIOS is the FFT library using AVX2 that is dedicated to the ring R\[X\]/(X^N+1) for N a power of 2. These codes come from [experimental-tfhe](https://github.com/tfhe/experimental-tfhe/tree/master/circuit-bootstrapping/src/spqlios). We just renamed instances to adapt to our codes.

## SPQLIOS-AVX512
This is the AVX512 version of SPQLIOS developed in [MOSFHET](https://github.com/antoniocgj/MOSFHET). I confirmed that this is faster than SPQLIOS on Intel i5-11400 and AMD Ryzen 7700X. 

## FFTW3
[FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/) is one of the most famous FFT libraries. 

**CAUTION**: REDISTRIBUTING BINARY WHICH DEPENDS ON FFTW3 MEANS YOU AGREED WITH GPLv3 OR LATER.

## MKL
Intel MKL is the library provided by Intel and including FFTW compatible interface for FFT.
We assume to install MKL by [this procedure](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/guide/installing-free-libraries-and-python-apt-repo.html) and already ran `source /opt/intel/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh`.

Add `-DUSE_MKL` to the CMake option to use MKL

### FFTW3 API
To use this, you have to also add `-DUSE_FFTW3`.

### Native API
Instead of FFTW3 API, I also added native API version. This will be enabled if `-DUSE_FFTW3` is not specified with `-DUSE_MKL`.

## concrete-fft
concrete-fft is the pure rust FFT library developed by Zama.ai. This can be enabled by `-DUSE_CONCRETE_FFT`.

## spqliox_aarch64
spqliox_aarch64 is the FFT library for aarch64 forked from SPQLIOS.
This is slightly faster than FFTW3(average 1ms).
This library requires [xbyak_aarch64](https://github.com/fujitsu/xbyak_aarch64), and
to use this library, add `-DUSE_SPQLIOX_AARCH64=on` to the CMake option.

<center>

| FFTW3    | spqliox_aarch64 |
| :------: | :-------------: |
| 15.801ms | 14.368ms        |

</center>

## HEXL

[HEXL](https://github.com/intel/hexl.git) is the NTT library optimized for AVX512. 
To use this library, add `-DUSE_HEXL=on` to the CMake option.

# Speed Test

Following Code measure how many time homomorphic NAND takes on your computer with TFHEpp. 
```
git clone https://github.com/virtualsecureplatform/TFHEpp
cd TFHEpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_TEST=ON
make
ulimit -s unlimited
./test/nand 
```

If you want to run semantically equivalent test on original TFHE, run below code.
```
git clone https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe.git --recursive
cd tfhe
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -DENABLE_TESTS=on -DENABLE_NAYUKI_PORTABLE=off -DENABLE_NAYUKI_AVX=off -DENABLE_SPQLIOS_AVX=off -DENABLE_SPQLIOS_FMA=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=optim
make
./test/test-gate-bootstrapping-spqlios-fma
```

If you have Docker on your system, this will do above on docker.

```
git clone https://github.com/virtualsecureplatform/TFHEpp
cd TFHEpp
docker build -t tfheppbench .
```

This is for TFHE-10ms. Because TFHE-10ms only supports 80-bit security parameter, this is not included in Dockerfile
```
git clone https://github.com/virtualsecureplatform/tfhe-10ms.git --recursive
cd tfhe-10ms
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -DENABLE_TESTS=on -DENABLE_NAYUKI_PORTABLE=off -DENABLE_NAYUKI_AVX=off -DENABLE_SPQLIOS_AVX=off -DENABLE_SPQLIOS_FMA=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=optim
make
./test/test-bootstrapping-fft-spqlios-fma 
```
